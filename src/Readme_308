This Java project automates interactions with the e-junkie website,

powered by Selenium WebDriver, performs the following actions:

1. Navigates to the [e-junkie homepage](https://www.e-junkie.com/).
2. Finds and clicks the "See How it works" button.
3. Verifies the URL to ensure it remains "https://www.e-junkie.com/".
4. Initiates playback of a video in a YouTube window that opens as a result.
5. Closes the window after 10 seconds.
