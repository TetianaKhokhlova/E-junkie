-Contact Form Automation

This project is an automated testing solution designed to interact
with a contact form on a website.
Utilizing Selenium WebDriver, the automation script navigates to the homepage,
locates and clicks the "Contact Us" button,
fills out the contact form with predefined details,
attempts to submit the form, and verifies the display of a "Recaptcha Didn't Match" alert.
This project serves as a proof of concept for automated UI testing,
specifically for form submission and captcha validation feedback.
